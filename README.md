Included in this package are three file-handling utilities I've created to help automated workflows:

* file_compare - this tool takes in two files and compares them, then generates a diff log similar to git diff
* file_converters - this tool converts a given file into other file types - note only works with flat file types like txt, csv, etc
* file_splitter - this tool will split any given csv, txt, or xl file containing rows into n number of subfiles based on the number you select via command line argument
